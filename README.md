# ðŸ’» LeetCode Python Problem Solving

Welcome to my **LeetCode Python Solutions** repository!

This repository contains my Python problem solving approach and solutions to LeetCode problems, systematically categorized by difficulty level:

- **Easy**
- **Medium**
- **Hard**

Each problem has its own dedicated Python file, which includes:

- **Problem Explanation** â€“ A brief overview of the problem statement.
- **Solution Intuition** â€“ The thought process and reasoning behind the approach taken.
- **Python Code** â€“ A well-structured solution to the problem.
- **Alternative Solutions** (if applicable) â€“ Some problems feature multiple solutions for optimization or to explore different approaches.

## Why This Repository?

This collection serves as a structured reference for:

- Learning **Python techniques** through real-world problems.
- Understanding different ways to solve Python challenges efficiently.
- Exploring **optimizations** and alternative methods for better performance.
- Gaining insights into **Python coding patterns** commonly used in technical interviews.
